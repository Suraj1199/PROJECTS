features is a clever way to learn non-linear relations using a linear model. In our problem, if we just use the feature `latitude` for learning, the model might learn that city blocks at a particular latitude (or within a particular range of latitudes since we have bucketized it) are more likely to be expensive than others. Similarly for the feature `longitude`. However, if we cross `longitude` by `latitude`, the crossed feature represents a well defined city block. If the model learns that certain city blocks (within range of latitudes and longitudes) are more likely to be more expensive than others, it is a stronger signal than two features considered individually.\n","\n","Currently, the feature columns API only supports discrete features for crosses. To cross two continuous values, like `latitude` or `longitude`, we can bucketize them.\n","\n","If we cross the `latitude` and `longitude` features (supposing, for example, that `longitude` was bucketized into `2` buckets, while `latitude` has `3` buckets), we actually get six crossed binary features.
